# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the homepage hero by updating the headline text, presenting the logo in a circular frame, and applying a modern welding-themed hero background while keeping content readable.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Hero section main heading to: "Welding & Metal Fabrication Solutions" (remove the word "Complete").
- Render the logo as a circle (instead of a square) anywhere it appears in the header/navigation and in the hero branding area.
- Add a local, modern welding-themed background image for the Home/Hero section and apply it with sufficient contrast so hero text and CTAs remain readable on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage displays the updated hero headline, the logo appears in a circular frame in the header and hero, and the hero section uses a modern welding background image with clear, readable text and buttons.
