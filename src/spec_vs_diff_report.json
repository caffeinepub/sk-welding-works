REQ-15 is partially implemented by referencing a local background image with readability overlays, but the diff does not show the required new static background asset being added to the repo (no files added). The diff also adds unrequested hero statistics content.",

      "reason": "HeroSection references /assets/generated/hero-welding-modern-bg.dim_1920x1080.png, but the diff shows no added files, so there is no evidence the requested background image asset was actually added as a local static file.",
